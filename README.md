## Project details must be mentioned
This SUSTech pintos project is slightly different from its original ones in Stanford or Berkeley. Prof. and TAs add some code in `thread.c` for testing. So it may cause some fail in original test cases. Besides, SUSTech pintos project1 do not include finishing multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduling. So, It may fail in the mlfqs test cases.

## Completeness
PASS all test cases which TAs asked.
